# üöÄ Beginner's Guide to Creating Routines

**Welcome to the Niva Routine Community!** This guide will help you create your first routine, even if you've never written code before.

## üéØ What is a Routine?

A routine is a series of steps that Niva helps you follow to build healthy habits. Think of it like a friendly guide that:
- Reminds you to do things at the right time
- Celebrates your progress
- Adapts to your energy levels
- Helps you build habits step by step

## üõ†Ô∏è Your First Routine: Step by Step

### Step 1: Choose Your Goal

Start with something simple that you want to improve. For example:
- **"I want to drink more water"**
- **"I want to remember to take my medication"**
- **"I want to have a better morning routine"**

### Step 2: Break It Down

Think about what steps would help you achieve this goal. For example, for "drink more water":
1. **Morning reminder** - "Time to start your day with water!"
2. **Mid-morning check** - "How's your hydration going?"
3. **Afternoon reminder** - "Don't forget to drink water!"
4. **Evening check** - "Great job staying hydrated today!"

### Step 3: Create Your Routine File

1. Go to the `examples` folder
2. Create a new file with a `.json` extension (e.g., `my-first-routine.json`)
3. Copy this basic template:

```json
{
  "title": "My First Routine",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A simple routine to help me [your goal]",
  "setupSteps": [
    {
      "type": "parameter_request",
      "question": "What time would you like to start this routine?",
      "parameterKey": "startTime",
      "parameterType": "LOCAL_TIME"
    }
  ],
  "phases": [
    {
      "title": "Getting Started",
      "steps": [
        {
          "type": "message",
          "message": "üåü Time for your routine!",
          "timeOfDay": "${startTime}",
          "expectedDurationMinutes": 1,
          "expectConfirmation": true
        },
        {
          "type": "action",
          "message": "Take a moment to [your action]",
          "timeOfDay": "${startTime}+PT2M",
          "expectedDurationMinutes": 5,
          "expectConfirmation": true
        },
        {
          "type": "action",
          "message": "‚úÖ Great job! You're building a healthy habit!",
          "timeOfDay": "${startTime}+PT8M",
          "expectedDurationMinutes": 1,
          "expectConfirmation": true
        }
      ],
      "schedule": "DAILY"
    }
  ],
  "triggers": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "type": "AFTER_PHASE_COMPLETIONS",
        "phaseTitle": "Getting Started",
        "times": 3
      },
      "effect": {
        "type": "SEND_MESSAGE",
        "message": "üéâ You've been doing this for 3 days! Your brain is building a new habit!"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Customize Your Routine

**Replace the placeholders:**
- `"My First Routine"` ‚Üí Your routine name
- `"[your goal]"` ‚Üí What you want to achieve
- `"[your action]"` ‚Üí What you want to do
- `"startTime"` ‚Üí A name for your time parameter

**Example for a water drinking routine:**

```json
{
  "title": "Hydration Helper",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A simple routine to help me drink more water throughout the day",
  "setupSteps": [
    {
      "type": "parameter_request",
      "question": "What time would you like to start your hydration routine?",
      "parameterKey": "hydrationStartTime",
      "parameterType": "LOCAL_TIME"
    }
  ],
  "phases": [
    {
      "title": "Morning Hydration",
      "steps": [
        {
          "type": "message",
          "message": "üíß Good morning! Time to start your day with water!",
          "timeOfDay": "${hydrationStartTime}",
          "expectedDurationMinutes": 1,
          "expectConfirmation": true
        },
        {
          "type": "action",
          "message": "Take a moment to drink a glass of water",
          "timeOfDay": "${hydrationStartTime}+PT2M",
          "expectedDurationMinutes": 5,
          "expectConfirmation": true
        },
        {
          "type": "action",
          "message": "‚úÖ Great job! You're taking care of your body!",
          "timeOfDay": "${hydrationStartTime}+PT8M",
          "expectedDurationMinutes": 1,
          "expectConfirmation": true
        }
      ],
      "schedule": "DAILY"
    }
  ],
  "triggers": [
    {
      "condition": {
        "type": "AFTER_PHASE_COMPLETIONS",
        "phaseTitle": "Morning Hydration",
        "times": 3
      },
      "effect": {
        "type": "SEND_MESSAGE",
        "message": "üéâ You've been hydrating for 3 days! Your brain is building a healthy habit!"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## üé® Making Your Routine Better

### Use Encouraging Language

**‚úÖ Good:**
- "Time to take care of yourself!"
- "You're doing great!"
- "Every small step counts!"

**‚ùå Avoid:**
- "You should..."
- "You must..."
- "Don't forget to..."

### Add Personalization

Ask for user preferences in `setupSteps`:
```json
{
  "type": "parameter_request",
  "question": "What's your favorite way to relax?",
  "parameterKey": "relaxationMethod",
  "parameterType": "STRING"
}
```

Then use it in your messages:
```json
{
  "type": "action",
  "message": "Time to practice your ${relaxationMethod}",
  "timeOfDay": "20:00",
  "expectedDurationMinutes": 10,
  "expectConfirmation": true
}
```

### Add Celebrations

Include triggers to celebrate progress:
```json
{
  "condition": {
    "type": "AFTER_PHASE_COMPLETIONS",
    "phaseTitle": "Getting Started",
    "times": 7
  },
  "effect": {
    "type": "SEND_MESSAGE",
    "message": "üéâ One week of progress! You're building a lasting habit!"
  }
}
```
